## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to create a link profile using HTML and CSS. This includes:

- **HTML structure**: I used elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<footer>` to organize the content of the page.
- **CSS styling**: We apply styles to improve the visual appearance of the page, using CSS rules to define colors, fonts, margins and other design aspects.
- **Responsive Design**: Made the link profile responsive, ensuring it looks good and works correctly on a variety of devices and screen sizes.


```html

```
```css
@media screen and (320px <= width <= 480px){

    #container{
        margin: 0px auto;
        margin-top: 25%;
        width: 75%;
    }
```
